# COMP90015-Distributed-System-Project2-2018S2
This project is about designing a Scrabble Game which allows multi-players to play at the same time and one winner will be ultimately got at the end of the game. This game is actually a word game in which each player will take turns to add one character at a time and get a score based on the word they generate. A client-server architecture is chosen which allows multiple users to do a series of operations.

This Login GUI(Graphical User Interfaces) is intended to help users check whether the connection between server and client is successful or not. In addition, once entering a wrong port number or invalid input, then users would receive an error message as a reminder.

When a player chooses a word to submit, it will be highlighted on the grid and could be seen by all players. If the chosen word is agreed by other players, the corresponding score will be given to the player and the updated score will be demonstrated on the Playersâ€™ Score panel.
